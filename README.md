Computer Science Foundations
Fall 2016 and Winter 2017 quarters

#Prerequisites#
High School Algebra II or its equivalent.

In this program students will have the opportunity to learn intellectual concepts and skills essential for advanced work in computer science and beneficial for computing work supporting other disciplines. Students will achieve a deeper understanding of increasingly complex computing systems by acquiring knowledge and skills in mathematical abstraction, problem-solving, and the organization, and analysis of hardware and software systems. The program covers material such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization and architecture, logic, discrete mathematics, and programming in the context of the liberal arts and compatible with model curriculum developed by the Association for Computing Machinery's Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium.

Program content will be organized around four interwoven themes. The computational organization theme covers concepts and structures of computing systems from digital logic to the computer architecture supporting high-level languages and operating systems. The programming theme concentrates on learning how to design and code computer programs to solve problems. The mathematical theme helps develop mathematical reasoning, theoretical abstractions, and problem-solving skills needed for computer scientists. A technology and society theme explores social, historical, or philosophical topics related to science and technology.
